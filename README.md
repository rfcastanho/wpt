# Wireless Power Transfer
Algorithms for design of Wireless Power Transfer power pads.
A series of functions developed in Matlab to help designing power pads used in inductive power transfer applications.
These algorithms are called "exhaustive" for one simple reason: they make dozens, maybe hundreds of finite element simulations, adjusting the pad geometry until it outputs the target power.
